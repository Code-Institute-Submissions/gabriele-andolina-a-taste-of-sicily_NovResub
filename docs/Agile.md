### **3.3 Epics & User Stories - Further Details on Testing**

#### **User Story 2.4**
 Strictly speaking, this user story has to be given a "Fail" verdict because the user receives an e-mail upon registering, so that he may confirm his e-mail address, but not a follow-up e-mail to confirm the success of the process. The confirmation is, however, provided on the website, thus allowing the user to know he now has a working account on A Taste Of Sicily. 
 Please see the screenshots below:

#### **User Story 4.2**
 This user story has been given a "Fail" verdict because two buttons ("Update" and "Remove") are provided to update the quantity of an item or remove it altogether from within the cart, and yet only the "Update" button currently works. This is a bug I have not been able to find a solution to yet, which needs to be fixed for a successful user experience.


## **4. Agile Development**

The tool I chose to keep track of my work is Asana, due to its popularity and to some sort of acquaintance due to my previous project.
On Asana, I organized my work in Epics and User Stories (see the above section for all the Epics and User Stories), finding Asana a practical tool to organize smaller subtasks such as the User Stories from the same card.

Below is a detail sample of an Epic and its organization as it showed on the kanban board:

### **5. Bugs & Improvements:**
- *Remove button - Cart:* This bug need to be fixed to prevent user frustration and optimize the website chances of a successful UX.
- *Forms - Poor formatting:* Although all the forms found on the website work successfully, their formatting needs to be uniformed and improved for a better-looking website and a more pleasant UX.
- *Buttons - Styling:* Buttons need to be given a uniform outlook for a better-looking website and a more pleasant UX. For example, some buttons have rounded corners whereas others have squared ones. Also, the newsletter sign-up form button is different than the other ones on the website.
