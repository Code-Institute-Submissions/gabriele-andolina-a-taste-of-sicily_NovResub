# **SEO & Marketing**

## **1. SEO**

For the keyword research process, I started by writing down ideas for short-tail and long-tail keywords, which I then started checking on Wordtracker.com. However, I could not complete the whole process on this website due to the limited number or research attempts offered as a trial. Nor could I continue in incognito mode. For this reason, I Googled the most important keywords, choosing and highlighting the ones that returned the highest number of results (in millions). This research allowed me to add the words "shop" and "tour" to my original list. The first one showed consistently when searching the possibility of buying Italian or Sicilian food online, whereas the second one could, in my opinion, encourage tourists to visit the company when the tasting and visit experiences are actually launched.

## **2. Marketing**

The marketing thought process had to start from the site owners profile. Who are they, what kind of business do they own, and what could they afford at this stage of their growth?
Being a small company, A Taste Of Sicily now need and can only afford to avail itself of free marketing techniques. For this reason, I chose the following:
* Search Engine Optimization (as described in the above section);
* Content Marketing + Social Media Marketing, which can be implemented in the future by creating Facebook and Instagram posts, as well as YouTube videos, all showing different aspects of the life of the company and its products. These different platforms will allow the company to reach users of different age, thus increasing its chances to promote itself. See below for a mockup Facebook page.
* Email marketing, implemented via a Mailchimp newsletter.
