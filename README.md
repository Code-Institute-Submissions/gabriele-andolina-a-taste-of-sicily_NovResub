A Taste Of Sicily is the online shop for a Sicilian company of the same name, currently offering the possibility to purchase gourmet products from the same producer and soon growing to include tasting and visit experiences in Sicily. 


## **2. General User Goals** 

### **2.1 Site Owners' Goals**
The persona I have thought of/created for this project is Domenico Montalbano, a fictional farmer and the current president of the company. He understands that in the digital age we live in it is impossibile to thrive as a business unless one has an established presence online. He envisions the company's website as a key channel to promote his company and products, as well as to promote Sicily, the region where he was born and which he desires other people to appreciate as he himself does.

### **2.2. User Goals**
* General users:
Italian food is generally appreciated by many people abroad. For this reason, the first category of site users is made up of Italian food buffs who surf the Internet to discover new products. 
* Returning users:
The second category of users is made up of the people that have already made a purchase on the website. Having found the products to be of great quality, they come back to the website to purchase the items they liked or try new ones.

## **6. Validation and Performance**
### 6.1 *Validator Testing*
* HTML
   * Some errors are shown in the deployed version of the code when passed through the official W3C Markup Validator via URI.  
   These do not affect the correct functioning of the website, but need to be addressed during the following stages of the development process.

   ![W3C HTML Validation](docs/images/html-validation.png)

* CSS 
   * No errors were found when passing through the official W3C Jigsaw Validator.

   ![W3C CSS Validation](docs/images/css-validation.png)

* PEP8
   * The .py files in the project were checked with the Python linter within the Gitpod environment during the whole development process, ensuring that no key errors were committed.

The site is fully responsive. 
Manual testing has been performed on the following three devices:  
- MacBook Pro (Retina, 13 inch, Late 2013);
- iPad Pro (12.9 inch, Third Generation);

## **9. Credits**
### 9.1 *Credits*
All code was written by me personally. The core flow and structure of the website, however, are modelled on the *Boutique Ado* walkthrough project by the Code Institute. 
### 9.2 *Content*
The entirety of the content found on the website has been created by me personally. I drew from my personal experience and frequentation of Sicily to think of potential products and experiences the company could sell. However, due to the availability of (truly!) free-stock reusable photos online, I also had to add some fictional bits here and there. For instance, I am not aware of a Sicilian apple cider (but I could be wrong!). The best way to find out about Sicilian product is, therefore, to visit Sicily personally. I encourage you to do so!

## **10. Acknowledgments**

This project would have been impossible without the help of some incredible people, whom I wish to thank here.
- A special thank you goes to my mentor, Mr Richard Wells, for continuous guidance, suggestions and much needed encouragement. Almost one year has passed since our first meeting, and I am truly thankful to have found him.
- Thank you to all the talented people of the Tutoring team that helped me out: John, Ed, Ger, Alex, Gemma and Jason. You have been very kind and tremendously helpful as I struggled with some parts of my work.
- The highest praise and thanks go to God, the greatest Coder of all eternity. To Him, who has shown his eternal love for all of us in Jesus Christ. To Him, whom I owe everything.
